# Classprojects- Hello! My name is Shenna Hinton, and I’m excited to gain more knowledge about technology and innovation. I’m majoring in computer technology because I enjoy learning how systems work and how they can make life more efficient.

My goal is to build a career in automation, creating smart solutions that improve how things are done. I’m excited about working with advanced technology and contributing to future innovations.

Outside of school and career goals, I love spending time with my family and traveling. Exploring new places and making memories with loved ones keeps me inspired and motivated.
