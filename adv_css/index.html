                <h2>Let's Talk Sunflowers</h2>
                <p>Sunflowers originated in North America and are known for their large flower heads composed of thousands of tiny individual flowers. When young, they exhibit heliotropism, meaning they follow the suns movement across the sky. As they mature, however, the flowers settle facing east to attract pollinators and absorb morning sunlight. Each sunflower can produce between 1,000 and 2,000 seeds during its lifetime. These seeds are widely used for snacks, cooking oil, and as a nutritious food source for wildlife and livestock. Sunflowers beautifully combine ecological importance with practical value.</p>

        <p>The sunflower genus (Helianthus) consists of about 67 different species. In Europe, the most commonly cultivated varieties are the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus). Plants in this genus produce distinctive flower heads, which may appear singly or clustered in groups. Depending on the species, their height can vary greatly—from as little as 20 centimetres to well over five metres. Compact varieties, such as the popular Sunspot sunflower, are particularly well-suited for growing in pots or small gardens. Altogether, Helianthus species display remarkable diversity in both form and use.</p>
