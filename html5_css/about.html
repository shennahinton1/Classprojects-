            <p>Sunflowers are large, annual plants from the daisy family, native to North and South America, known for their striking appearance and ability to follow the sun. The large "flower head" is actually made of hundreds of tiny florets, with the outer ones forming the yellow petals and the inner ones developing into edible seeds used for food or oil. They require full sun to grow well and are used for a variety of purposes, including as a food source, for oil production, and for their aesthetic beauty.</p>
