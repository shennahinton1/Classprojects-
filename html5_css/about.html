            <h3>Sunflower Fun Facts</h3>
            <img src="images1/Unknown.jpeg" alt="sunflower image">
            <p>Sunflowers are tall, annual plants from the daisy family, native to both North and South America. They are admired for their bright, striking appearance and their unique ability to follow the sun throughout the day. What appears to be a single large flower is actually made up of hundreds of tiny florets—the outer ones form the yellow petals, while the inner florets mature into edible seeds. These seeds are commonly used for food and oil production, making the sunflower both beautiful and practical. Sunflowers thrive in full sunlight and are valued not only for their usefulness but also for their cheerful, decorative appeal.</p>
